# release-to-jira

A GitHub action to automatically create releases on JIRA.

Creates a release on Github. Uses its auto-generated description to find related JIRA issues and updates their "Fix versions" field. If a release matching the tag doesn't exist on JIRA, it will be automatically created.

This flow assumes auto-generated release notes will include JIRA issue keys. This can be achieved by including JIRA issue key in PR titles.
